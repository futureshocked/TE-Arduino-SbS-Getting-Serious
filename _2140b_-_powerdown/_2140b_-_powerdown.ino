/* Sleep Demo Serial
 * -----------------
 * Example code to demonstrate the sleep functions in an Arduino.
 *
 * The program will count to 10 and the go to sleep. To wake it up
 * use a jumper wire to bring digital pin 2 to low (connect it to GND).
 * This will take INT0 external interrupt to LOW, thus trigger
 * an interrupt request.
 *
 * there is also a time counter that will put the MCU to sleep after 10 secs
 *
 * NOTE: when coming back from POWER-DOWN mode, it takes a bit
 *       until the system is functional at 100%!! (typically <1sec)
